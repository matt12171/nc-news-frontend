# Welcome to my project NC-News. 

This app is a news app that displays articles and comments and allows the user to interact with them on a responsive website.

This is a full stack application that uses an [api](https://github.com/matt12171/nc-news) that I built in order to store and display the information.

## This project was built using 

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
[React](https://react.dev/)
[React bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app/)

This app was developed using Node.js v21.1.0. Using any earlier versions of node to host locally may cause unknown issues. 

## How to run locally 

`git clone <repo-url>`

`cd` into cloned repo.

`npm install`

`npm run dev`

This will now give you a local link to view the project hosted on your own computer.
